					<p class="align-left"><a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/">Guild Wars 2</a> is an MMORPG with various player choices available.  Some choices are available at character 
					creation (name, race, gender, profession), while others are available through in game content 
					(crafting disciplines, weapon choice, specializations, order).  Players can choose any combination of these to 
					fully create their unique character.  Names are simply strings of characters, and gender is male or female. 
					Race is one of five options: Charr, Asura, Sylvari, Human, and Norn.  Profession is one of nine options: 
					Elementalist, Necromancer, Mesmer, Ranger, Thief, Engineer, Guardian, Warrior, and Revenant.  The professions 
					can be grouped by armor type, the first three are light-armor, the second three are medium-armor, and the last 
					three are heavy armor.  Weapons are profession specific, such that an Elementalist cannot use a sword but can 
					use a dagger, while the Warrior can use the sword but not the dagger.  Each profession has its own unique set of 
					specializations, broken down into five core specializations and one elite specialization.  Each specialization 
					contains three tiers of effects to choose from, with each tier having one passively granted and one out of three 
					actively granted. These are the minor and major traits, respectively. In total, there will be three minor traits 
					and three major traits chosen for each specialization, and each character can choose three specializations, totaling 
					to eighteen traits.  There are three orders for players to choose from (Durmand Priory, Vigil, Order of Whispers) 
					by going through the characterâ€™s personal story.  There are eight crafting disciplines to choose from: 
					Huntsman, Weaponsmithing, Artificing, Leatherworking, Armorsmithing, Tailoring, Jeweling, and Chef.  Each character 
					can choose two of these disciplines, with the option of paying for a premium type purchase to increase this number.</p>

					<p class="align-left">The data would be collected using the <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main">Guild Wars 2 API</a> along with player participation.  Players will have to 
					generate a unique API code in order to allow the site to collect their information about the choices they have made.  
					I plan to ask my guilds as well as make a post on the forum asking for people to use the site.  The data would come in 
					a format similar to CSV to allow for fairly easy parsing.  The trick will be to use the API effectively in order to 
					transform number codes into proper terminology.  Given that enough people participate in my data collection, there 
					should be ample data and I plan to gather all character information for each character in the account, giving a large 
					number of attributes for each player record.  This will allow for the detailed analysis of whether choice matters in 
					character creation or if certain combinations will be the majority of player decisions.<br />
					The major question will be if certain attributes are linked stronger together than others, such as race, profession, 
					and crafting disciplines.  Are these three linked in any way such that a prediction can be made about the crafting 
					disciplines a player will choose given a race and profession?  This type of information is useful as it can restrict the 
					complexity for future games.  Players like choices, but do the choices need to be so complex?  If a majority of Human 
					Warriors choose Weaponsmithing and Jeweling as their crafting disciplines, creating a Human Warrior could then unlock 
					those disciplines at character creation.  This would reduce the information needed to be stored, as the Human Warrior 
					could then just link to a Weaponsmithing/Jeweling crafting discipline combination.  It will also be interesting to see 
					the connections players make between race and profession.  Will there be any connection at all?  If there is, the 
					character creation could then be simplified further.  I would use a linking node graph that would weight each connection 
					based on the number of times it appears.  As players enter their data, the graph would update to reflect the most 
					recently entered data.  As the data set increases, the change in the graph will be minimal for each new player, and 
					conclusions can then start to be formed.</p>

					<p class="align-left">Step 1: Log in to your Guild Wars 2 account.<br>
					<img src="images/my_acc.jpg"><br><img src="images/login.jpg"><br>
					Step 2: Click Applications tab.<br>
					<img src="images/app.jpg"><br>
					Step 3: Create a new key.<br>
					<img src="images/new_key.jpg"><br>
					Step 4: Generate a key with account and character permissions. Note that only character permissions will be used,
					the account permission is required to generate the key. A name can be given at the top if you would like.<br>
					<img src="images/key.jpg"><br>
					Step 5: Your key has been generated! Copy the key to use on this site to add your character data to the current data. 
					In the picture below, the key is highlighted in blue. Note that this is a key generated to demonstrate the steps required,
					the key has been deleted and will not work.<br>
